### Service Management

ITIL 4 defines a service as: 
> A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that  customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage  specific costs and risks

### Understand the key concepts of Service Management
#### Definitions:  Section 1.1 (2 points)
- Service: A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks
- Utility: The functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. To have utility, a service must either support the consumer and / or remove constraints from the consumer.
- Warranty: Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers.
- Customer: The role that defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption
- User: The role that uses services
- Service Management: A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services
- Sponsor: The role that authorizes budget for service consumption

#### Key concepts: Section 1.2 (2 points)
- Cost: The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource
  - Costs removed from a consumer
  - Costs imposed on a consumer
  - Costs can be expressed in non-monetary terms such as time spent, people allocated, etc.
- Value: The perceived benefits, usefulness and importance of something co-created through an active collaboration between providers, consumers and other organizations
- Organisation: A person or a group of people that has its own functions with responsibilities, authorities and relationships to achieve its objectives
- Outcome: A result for a stakeholder enabled by one of more outputs
- Output: A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity
- Risk: A possible event that could cause harm or loss, or make it more difficult to achieve objectives.
  - Risks removed from a consumer
  - Risks imposed on a consumer
- Utility: The functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. To have utility, a service must either support the consumer and / or remove constraints from the consumer.
- Warranty: Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. (SLA)

### Understand ITIL Guiding Principles
#### Explain: Section 2.2 (5 points)
- Focus on value:
  - Everything should link to value
  - Value is defined by the consumer’s needs
  - Value is achieved through the support of intended outcomes and optimization of the service consumer’s costs and risks
  - Value changes over time and in different circumstances
  - Who is the consumer and what is the customer’s perception of value?
  - Why does the consumer use the services and what do the services help them to do?
  - How does the services help the consumer meet their goals?
  - What are the cost/financial consequences and risk for the service consumer?
- Start where you are:
  - Assess where you are
  - Role of measurement
  - Look at what exists as objectively as possible, using the customer, or the desired outcome, as the starting point
  - When examples of successful practices or services are found in the current state, determine if and how these can be replicated or expanded upon to achieve the desired state

    - Apply your risk management skills
    - Recognize that sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused

- Progress iteratively with feedback:
  - Try not to do all at once
  - Start small building into large improvement
  - Feedback will help understand:
    - End user and customer perception of the value created
    - The efficiency and effectiveness of value chain activities
    - The effectiveness of service governance as well as management controls
    - The interfaces between the organization and partner / supplier network
    - The demand for products and services
- Collaborate and promote visibility:
  - Involve the right people
  - Inclusion better than exclusion
  - Cooperation / collaboration better than ‘silo’
  - With whom to collaborate - stakeholders
  - Communication for improvement
  - Increase urgency through visibility
- Think and work holistically:
  - How does it all work together? 
  - Nothing stands alone
  - End to end visibility
  - Altering one element can impact others
- Keep it simple and practical:
  - Minimum number of steps
  - Outcome based thinking
  - Eliminate things of no value
  - Handle exceptions generally not individually
  - Judging what to keep
  - Start with an uncomplicated approach
  - Agree on objectives
- Optimise and automate:
  - Optimization means to make something as effective and useful as it needs to be
  - Automation typically refers to the use of technology to perform a step or series of steps correctly and consistently with limited or no human intervention

### Four Dimensions of Service Management
#### Describe: Section 3.1 (2 points)
- Organisations and People

  - Roles and responsibilities
  - Organizational structure
  - Culture
  - Staffing and competences

- Information and Technology

  - What information is managed by the services?

  - How will the information and knowledge assets be protected, managed, archived and disposed of?
  - Compatibility with the current architecture and customer(s)
  - Regulatory / compliance issues with the organization's policies and information security controls or those of its customers
  - Viability in the future
  - Alignment with our strategy or our service consumers

    - Strategic focus
    - Corporate culture
    - Resource scarcity 
    - Cost
    - Subject matter expertise
    - External constraints
    - Demand patterns

- Value Streams and Processes

  - Process - a set of interrelated or interacting activities that transform
    inputs into outputs. Processes define the sequence of actions and their dependencies

  - Value stream - a series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and services to consumers
