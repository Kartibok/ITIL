  - Compatibility with the current architecture and customer(s)
  - Regulatory / compliance issues with the organization's policies and information security controls or those of its customers

[^Achieving Value]: Outcome, costs and risks

#### ITIL Guiding Principles
##### 2.2: 5 points

- Focus on value:
  - Everything should link to value
  - Value is defined by the consumer’s needs
  - Value is achieved through the support of intended outcomes and optimization of the service consumer’s costs and risks
  - Value changes over time and in different circumstances
  - Who is the consumer and what is the customer’s perception of value?
  - Why does the consumer use the services and what do the services help them to do?
  - How does the services help the consumer meet their goals?
  - What are the cost/financial consequences and risk for the service consumer?

- Start where you are:
  - Assess where you are
  - Role of measurement
  - Look at what exists as objectively as possible, using the customer, or the desired outcome, as the starting point
  - When examples of successful practices or services are found in the current state, determine if and how these can be replicated or expanded upon to achieve the desired state
  - Apply your risk management skills
  - Recognize that sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused

- Progress iteratively with feedback:
  - Try not to do all at once
  - Start small building into large improvement
  - Feedback will help understand:
    - End user and customer perception of the value created
    - The efficiency and effectiveness of value chain activities
    - The effectiveness of service governance as well as management controls
    - The interfaces between the organization and partner / supplier network
    - The demand for products and services

- Collaborate and promote visibility:
  - Involve the right people
  - Inclusion better than exclusion
  - Cooperation / collaboration better than ‘silo’
  - With whom to collaborate - stakeholders
  - Communication for improvement
  - Increase urgency through visibility

- Think and work holistically:
  - How does it all work together? 
  - Nothing stands alone
  - End to end visibility
  - Altering one element can impact others

- Keep it simple and practical:
  - Minimum number of steps
  - Outcome based thinking
  - Eliminate things of no value
  - Handle exceptions generally not individually
  - Judging what to keep
  - Start with an uncomplicated approach
  - Agree on objectives

- Optimise and automate:
  - Optimization means to make something as effective and useful as it needs to be
  - Automation typically refers to the use of technology to perform a step or series of steps correctly and consistently with limited or no human intervention
